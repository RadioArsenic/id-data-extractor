# ID Data Extractor (CITS3200 Project)

ID Data Extractor is an SDK containing a Python app that extracts and interprets data from images of ID documents — namely Australian driver's licences, and all types of passports — and passes the data to a Flutter app in JSON format. The SDK will be used to help companies conform with the [Know Your Customer](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/core-guidance/customer-identification-and-verification/customer-identification-know-your-customer-kyc) procedures. As such we only extract names, dates, and Australian addresses.
